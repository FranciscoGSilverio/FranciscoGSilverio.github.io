This repository was created to deploy the custom login page build with html and css

The login page was made during an HTML/CSS pratice in which I searched for a screen designed with Figma and tried to reproduce that using what I have learned so far.

The deseign I found was this one: https://www.figma.com/@tonyzebastian. I found that really interesting and tried my best to reproduce it the way is was created. 

Even though the original idea was to create a page just like the one designed with figma, I decided to chanhe some things because of the short time I'd have to dedicate 
to this project, so it might not look exactly as in the original project.

Also, I added a footer just to add some information to the page such as my name, de designer name and the tlink to its original word and also my contacts.
If you liked what you saw ow have any ideas of improvement, feel free to let met know :)
